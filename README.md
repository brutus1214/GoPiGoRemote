# GoPiGoRemote
GoPiGo remote control with video

This project is educate/introduce Ethan (my son) to world of programming.
About a month ago, I bought him a Python Projects for Kids(Jessica Ingrassellino) to start on Python programming. He claim finished.
so, I bought GoPiGo two weeks ago right before our vacation. He assembled GoPiGo by himself with Dexter's instruction.
He played robot with Dexter's built in os and play brick programming.
This week, I have new idea that I want to control GoPiGo from my phone using WIFI, I google 'ed and found RobotRemote 
(cameronfr)(google play store). Which is great app but I decide build something I more simple with video feeding.
As of today (Apr 12, 2018) First version without video is completed.

TODO: video feeding will be better.

I will have another README for how to test or how I test.
